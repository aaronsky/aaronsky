### I'm a _development productivity engineer_ based in Boston.

Build infrastructure and tooling developer with specialties with iOS and Android application development. Currently a senior developer at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/), managing our cloud-based build infrastructure for services, applications, and generalized testing pipelines. Previously at [SapientRazorfish](https://www.sapientrazorfish.com/) integrating native SDKs with React Native apps, and at [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) as an SDET. 

I have been working in the mobile space professionally since 2013, and in cloud infrastructure since 2019. I also love to cook!
