College is a big personal decision. Not everyone can or should do it, regardless of what you're being told to do. Less and less people my age have their minds set on a specific career, and while I can understand the idea that you shouldn't be expected to know what you want to do when you're 18, it isn't impossible. This post is for the people who know exactly what they want to do when they go into the workforce.

1) You still might not know for certain
    college lets you explore in a safe space
2) College still might not be the answer
    plenty of self-taught engineers, artists, business-owners
3) You won't learn enough
    the classroom cannot teach everything. personal projects are integral, make connections, go to office hours if you must, if you have labs, talk to people in them about relevant things
4) Find a school that is friendly towards internships
    this is hella important
    in computing, experience and personal drive are the most important things if you want to succeed. if your school makes you jump through a bunch of hoops in order to go on internship during a semester or the summer, they are a bad fit.
5) Start saving ASAP
    blessed to have parents who were saving before I was born. I will only have federal student loans
