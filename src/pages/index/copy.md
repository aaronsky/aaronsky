### Hello!

I'm a software developer based in Boston, Massachusetts. My primary focus is tools and infrastructure development for mobile apps. I have been developing apps since 2010 and have been working in apps professionally since 2015. I'm currently a senior app platforms engineer at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/). Previously, I've worked extensively on React Native apps at [SapientRazorfish](https://www.sapientrazorfish.com/) and as a QA engineer at [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/). I graduated in 2016 from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a degree in Game Design and Development, which I feel has driven my demand for ergonomics and dynamic interactivity in my tools and application work.

An abridged form of my work experience can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronsky/). My open source contributions can be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronsky/) activity log.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy cooking, baking, and expanding my palette. I'm always working on some kind of game project on the side, though these days it's primarily to sate my hobby.
