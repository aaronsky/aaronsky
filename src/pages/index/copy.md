### Hello!

I'm a software developer based in Boston, Massachusetts. My primary focus is iOS development, though I have experience developing in Android and WinRT/UWP as well. I have been developing apps since 2010 and have been working in apps professionally since 2015. My work experience can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronsky/). My open source contributions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronsky/) and on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~aaronsky). I'm currently an iOS developer at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/). Previously, I've worked extensively on React Native apps at [SapientRazorfish](https://www.sapientrazorfish.com/) and as a QA engineer at [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/).

Outside of programming, I enjoy cooking, baking, pickling, and exploring the City of Boston. I am always working on some game project on the side, though I'm mainly just a hobbyist. You can usually find me in Amory Park in the summer and autumn, or trying to stay warm in the winter.
