Time to cook with me, a developer who can also cook. 
<!--more-->

It's definitely been a while since I posted something here. I've been very busy with my new job working for [SapientNitro](http://www.sapientnitro.com/en-us.html#home), and even though I've only been there for a month, I've already been involved in some great work and I'm looking forward to times ahead.

I'm going to divert from my normal topics of development and education. Now that I'm in the real world with the increasingly real need to take care of myself, I've been cooking cool stuff. I did most of the cooking in college and I cooked most meals in my own kitchen during last year's Boston internship adventures. I've always been interested in cooking, partly because I love to eat and more recently than childhood because I love to try new things. With that said, I have taken my own bolognese recipe (based heavily on the one at [SORTEDFood.com](https://sortedfood.com/recipe/1067)) and made adjustments based on what I had in my spice garden, what I had in my fridge, and what kind of bolognese I felt like making tonight. It tasted and smelled amazing and I really wanted to share this!

### Ingredients: 

* 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 pound 85-90% lean ground beef
* 1 yellow onion
* 3 cloves garlic
* A handful of fresh basil or 1 tsp dried basil
* A handful of fresh oregano or 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried rosemary
* 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper, adjust for tolerance
* Freshly ground salt and black pepper
* 1 Anaheim pepper (optional)
* 3 carrots
* 4 stalks of celery
* 2 zucchinis
* 10 oz of white mushrooms
* 1 tsp tomato puree (also known tomato paste)
* 1 cup red wine (I used cabernet sauvignon)
* 24-26 oz of diced tomatoes
* 1/4 cup shredded parmesan, more to taste
* Fresh or dried parsley (optional)

### Steps:

1. Dice the onion, carrots, celery, zucchini and mushrooms. Mince the garlic and Anaheim pepper.
2. Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the beef and stir until brown.
3. Add the onion and stir until slightly translucent, about 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic, basil, oregano, rosemary, crushed red pepper, salt, black pepper, and Anaheim pepper. Stir for 1 minute.
4. Add carrots, celery, zucchini and mushrooms, and continue to saute until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and stir until disolved. Add the wine. Reduce, and stir occasionally.
5. Stir in the tomatoes and simmer on medium heat for 20 minutes, or on low for 2 hours.
6. Add the parmesan and mix in thoroughly. Add salt and pepper to taste, top with parsley, and serve over an al dente pasta. I'd recommend a thick noodle like linguine or fettucine. 

I hope you enjoy this!
