College is a big personal decision. 

In a way, it's too big a decision for a 14-year old to make. I say 14-year old because with today's growing cost of tuition it's the absolute latest you should make the decision to start planning. The needs for college preparedness are changing times and it's important to stay focused on your passions and academic strengths in order to make a good decision.

<!--more-->

* It isn't feasible to wait until high school to start saving, nor to let your parents decide for you. 
* Not everyone can or should go to college, regardless of what the adults in your life are telling you to do.
* Furthermore, the clich√© of getting your bachelor's degree by your early 20s is also slowly degrading. 

If that sounds daunting, that's because it is! It's incredibly tough to make a good decision with so little information, especially so early in one's life. You may not know your passions at this stage of your life. Less and less people my age have their minds set on a specific career. Conversely, the number of people who seek careers around their passions is growing. 

Unfortunately, many of those people are saddled with student loan debt from a degree that has served them little. I understand and empathize with the idea that you shouldn't be expected to know what you want to do with your life when you're 14, but it isn't impossible nor unheard of. 

This advice is for the people who know exactly what they want to do professionally, but may not be sure about the choice of college. To reign in the scope of this further, I'm going to focus on the fields of computing (and to similar extents, general engineering). Finally, everything in life has exceptions, so keep that implicit asterisk in mind with each of these points. 

### You might not actually know what you want to do

When I was 12, I discovered I wanted to go into game design after an eye-opening experience with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. I didn't know how I was going to do this but I loved playing games and now knew that actual human beings were involved in making them. As a result, I did extensive research and I practiced making games in code-free game creators (which were much worse and much less freely-available back in 2005!). I wanted to find a path into the games industry that would fit with my interests. Based on my findings, I determined that the best way to do this would be to focus on game design but maintain a basis in programming to get my foot in the door. That's why I ended up enrolling at RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology). They boasted one of the few dedicated four-year game development programs in the country.

Fast-forward to today, and things are different. I still have a passion for games and want to be a part of making them, but I underestimated how much I would adore programming. Game design has become more of a secondary interest. I love understanding systems and learning how to manipulate syntax, and I'm more receptive to gaining experience through general software development. I've also branched out and developed a comfortable niche in mobile development. 

That may be a rough way of starting this off, but it's true. Even though you may have an idea of what you want to do with your life, you may find that your interests will evolve or shift with age. However, don't let this consideration of doubt stop you. If you're confident in a path, experiment! One of the great things about college is how it lets you experiment with your passions in a safe, consequence-soft space while providing tons of opportunities for mentors and internship. 

### College still might not be the answer

Computing (and to a growing extent some fields of engineering) is a field that does not necessarily need a college degree. I'm going to be blunt on this one too because it's something I believe. **Completion of a four-year accredited degree program is not a requirement in order to get a good job in the software industry.** Some of the best developers I know are self-taught through books, community mentors, and open source contribution. While some say a degree makes you more competitive in the market (and in some cases is legally required), a collection of significant contributions to open source can conceivably carry more weight in the application process. Recruiters care about [engagement in your skills and a demonstrative eagerness to overcome new challenges](http://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/how-to-become-a-software-developer). 

That all being said, for many people, going to college is the right decision. It's very difficult to be completely self-taught, and without guidance your programming knowledge will contain some gaps. If any of the following apply to you, it may be worth pursuing a college degree.

1. Without a starting point for exploration, self-motivation can be an issue for you.
2. You learn better with an enforced structure.
3. You make better connections and produce better work surrounded by people who share my goals and interests.
4. You want to work in defense or computer science research.

College isn't for everyone and you shouldn't feel like it has to be for you. Strictly speaking it isn't a necessity for this line of work, but if you're determined to learn and value the structure inherent in the classroom environment, you should consider a degree. 

### You won't learn enough

You may have seen yourself in the points above and plan on making the commitment to go to college for computing. That's great! I wish you the best of luck. 

**You still won't learn enough.** 

It's an unfortunate and unavoidable fact that no degree can truly provide you with all the knowledge you need. This is exceedingly true in computing, where the history, rules and concepts that have built this field are too immense for any four-year degree program. Becoming an expert in programming is something that takes your entire life, much like art (future topic warning!). If you go into college (or are just leaving college) thinking you've learned everything you need to succeed, you're gravely mistaken.

This is why personal exploration is so crucial. Have personal projects where you try out new technologies or modes of thinking. Make self-motivated contributions to open source projects. Both are excellent ways to expand your knowledge beyond what they actually teach you in school. You may find a new facet of an existing passion, or discover some new technique you can bring to your own academic, professional, or personal life. 

For those who need some outside motivator to supplement their own drive to experiment, seeking out a mentor or other students with relevant interests outside of class is another excellent way to improve your skills. You may have chosen college because you needed a starting point or a structure for learning, but it's impossible for college to fulfill every skill you need to succeed in the professional world.

### Find a school that is friendly towards internships

This point is a tough one to resolve because very few colleges, to my knowledge, actively encourage and provide good frameworks for mid-program internships. I mentioned earlier that recruiters often value experience over a degree because it shows dedication to the craft, and internships are a great way to establish professional experience and learn real-world software practices as opposed to academic practices. 

One of the things I really do love about RIT, believe it or not, is the mandatory co-op requirement. Depending on your degree, you are expected to take two to three co-op blocks as part of your four to five-year degree requirements. Co-ops are required to be related to your major, full-time, and paid. When you go on co-op, your financial aid and tuition are automatically suspended, but legally you are still considered a full-time student during the co-op term. This is excellent for parents claiming their students as dependents, this is excellent for students who need the experience to become better developers and get better jobs out of school, and this is excellent for RIT who can use the prestige of the co-op program to promote themselves. 

If a university makes you jumps through a ton of hoops to go on internship, such as suspending your academic status or jeopardizing your financial aid, then they are not a good school for computing or engineering and I would seriously advise against attending these schools. These are not schools that keep the success of its engineering students in mind, and their outdated practices are not compatible with these fields. 

### Start saving ASAP

This is the final point I want to make, because it isn't something enough people are prepared for. It's also going to be my shortest point. College is expensive. College is REALLY expensive, and to be saddled with debt at one of the earliest stages of your adult life can be debilitating to achieve one's goals. If college is absolutely necessary, and even if it isn't, you must start preparing and saving as soon as possible. I was very fortunate to have a family who saved for my education from before I was born, but this is the exception rather than the rule. The sooner you commit to attending college, the sooner you should start saving. You can also consider this to be a recommendation that the sooner you decide college isn't for you, the sooner you should start saving to sustain yourself as an adult.

These are the five things I would keep in mind when deciding on college. Considerations are going to be different if your passions don't align with the demands of engineering, you aren't a career-motivated person, or if you don't have a great sense of what you want to with your life. With that in mind, I am anticipating this advice to be pretty niche. Hopefully this will help someone make an informed decision about planning for college, and whether or not college is the right choice.
