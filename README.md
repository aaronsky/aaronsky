## Hello!

I make developer productivity tools and operate infrastructure to automate away the papercuts that slow us all down. My focus has traditionally, been in the iOS and Android tools space, but I like to work on lots of different things. (He/him)

- :bird: My next gig will be developing on the media platform for iOS apps at Twitter
- :beer: I develop [Cider](https://github.com/cidertool/cider), a tool for automating app submission for Apple platforms to the App Store
- :apple: iOS, Swift, and Objective-C since 2014
- :iphone: My first app was a US-based delivery tracking app for Windows Phone 8
- :mag: In addition: Rust :crab:, Go :hamster:, TypeScript & Node.js :package:, Terraform :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:, Puppet :performing_arts:, Python :snake:, Ruby :gem:
- :speaking_head: In my spare time, I study Japanese :jp:, cook, and play Nintendo games!
