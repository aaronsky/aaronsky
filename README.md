## Hello!

I make developer productivity tools and operate infrastructure to automate away the papercuts that slow us all down. My focus has traditionally been in the iOS and Android tools space, but I like to work on lots of different things. (He/him)

-   :bird: My current gig is supporting the build infrastructure and developer experience for mobile engineering at Dropbox
-   :package: I develop [asc-swift](https://github.com/aaronsky/asc-swift), a Swift library for interfacing with the App Store Connect and Enterprise Program APIs from Apple.
-   :apple: iOS, Swift, and Objective-C since 2014
-   :iphone: My first app was a US-based delivery tracking app for Windows Phone 8, released in 2013
-   :mag: In addition: Bazel :leaves:, Rust :crab:, Go :hamster:, Python :snake:, TypeScript & Node.js :package:, Terraform :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:, Puppet :performing_arts:, Ruby :gem:
-   :speaking_head: In my spare time, I study Japanese :jp:, cook, and play Nintendo games!
